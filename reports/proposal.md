# "Choose Your Own Adventure" Game
## A Project to Learn C

### Team
MJ McMillen and Gracey Wilson

## Project Goal
Increase our understanding of basic C concepts like character arrays and pointers by creating our own “Choose Your Own Adventure” game. The game will use a lot of strings and decision making, allowing us to get lots of practice using basic concepts like pointers. Our lower bound goal is to make a game with at least 3 possible outcomes. Our upper bound goal is to incorporate ascii art into our adventure. We want to customize our journey to the player. We are also potentially interested in learning some C++, so might incorporate some object oriented programming if we have time.

## Learning Goals
Our learning goals for this project are very simple. We want to enforce good basic C coding habits and become more familiar with the idea of pointers. We also want to practice planning the architecture of a program/system of programs in C.

## What We Need To Get Started
We need to first plot out our story and define its scope. There are many websites out there that describe how to create your own choose an adventure story. We will need to ideate then build our code on how long we want this to be.

We may want access to a better string library because most of the project will revolve around string manipulation. We may want some help finding a good library and learning how to set up our code so it is not just a bunch of if statements. We have already started researching this (one of the [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3y8xw7/help_good_practice_for_writing_a_choose_your_own/) we've found so far) but we would appreciate any input you can share!

## Our First Steps
We will begin by individually completing a simple C “Choose Your Own Adventure” tutorial online. We will each discover and go through our own tutorials so that we hopefully learn an overlap of skills, but not exactly the same ones. We will also individually ideate about the storyline we want to have.

Next, we will meet and plan our story out on sticky notes. Once we have the shape of our game, we will then define the exact scope of the project, create diagrams, and begin coding. We need to do some ground work on the story before understanding which specific software tasks we have. This will mostly be very collaborative between us and we will share the work at all stages. This will allow us to work through the entire coding process to better understand all aspects of our project as individuals, even as we work to achieve more as a team than we could on our own.
